      <div class="content">
        Among the most popular mythological scenes produced by Lucas Cranach the Elder and his workshop were those featuring Venus and, in particular, the Judgment of Paris.[1] This legend relates how the goddess of discord Eris, peeved at not having been invited to the wedding of Peleus and Thetis, attended unannounced and threw her golden apple, inscribed "to the fairest" into the midst of the guests. Juno, Venus, and Minerva all claimed ownership of the prize, and Jupiter decreed that their dispute could be settled only by Paris, son of the king of Troy. After Mercury brought the goddesses to the Trojan prince, each offered him a bribe: Juno, power; Minerva, all human knowledge; and Venus, the love of Helen of Troy, wife of the Spartan king, Menelaus, and the world"s most beautiful woman. Paris chose Venus and embarked for Sparta to abduct Helen and bring her to Troy, thus instigating the Trojan War. [...] In the Museum"s painting, Paris has dismounted his horse and fallen asleep beneath a tree. Mercury nudges him awake with his staff, and Paris, in a sleepy stupor, observes the three beauties before him. He wears a full suit of knightly armor in the style of 1520 - 1525, including a lance rest; his sword is by his side and he holds a decoratively embellished gold war hammer. His long coat and puffed, slashed sleeves reflect contemporary courtly fashion; his huge beret with ostrich feather pom-poms, a type worn by high-ranking military commanders, perhaps was introduced here to appeal to the patron.[2] Mercury"s costume, including the breastplate with oak leaf decoration, the fringed red skirt beneath, and the extraordinary hat showing two birds ravenously eating seeds from a pod, is pure fantasy.[3] The apple he holds appears to be formed of rock crystal. The three goddesses are only very slightly differentiated, perhaps to emphasize the difficulty of Paris"s decision.[4] Which is Juno and which Minerva is unclear,[5] but the center figure must be Venus. It is she who is the most suggestively alluring, with her broad-brimmed, feather-adorned red hat and strategically placed diaphanous veil that accentuates all the more her otherwise naked state. It is also she who points to Cupid, who in turn prepares to shoot his arrow at her. The walled-in city in the background being approached by a large ship is presumably Troy, and the leaf less, dead branches on the tree directly above the figures may signal the destruction to come.
[1] Some nineteenth-century scholars thought the subject of this painting was the Anglo-Saxon legend of the knight Albonack presenting his daughters to King Alfred III of Mercia. For this legend, see M. Rosenberg 1930, pp. 91-96. R. Förster (1899, pp. 265; 73, pl. 10) refuted this interpretation for the Museum"s painting. [2] My thanks to Dirk H. Breiding, Assistant Curator, Department of Arms and Armor, MMA, for discussing with me the details of the armor worn by Paris and Mercury. [3]Inge El-Himoud-Sperlich (1977, pp. 54-55) claimed that Mercury wears the fantastic clothing of a herald in contemporary theater; it has been noted (in Metropolitan Museum 1987, p. 109) that Mercury"s dress is "appropriate to the Nordic messenger god Wotan [sic]." [4] Bodo Brinkmann noted this in relation to the Kimbell Art Museum version (Brinkmann in Frankfurt and London 2007/2008, p. 326, no. 101). [5] R. Förster (1899, p. 272) claimed that the goddess at the left is Juno, because she appears "somewhat more mature and restrained than the others" while the one at the right is Minerva, who chastely turns away from the viewer. Biedermann also identified the goddess with the hat as Venus in the closely related drawing in Braunschweig (fig. 49; Biedermann 1981, p. 312, fig. 7).
